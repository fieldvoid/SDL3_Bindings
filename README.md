# SDL3 Bindings
SDL3 bindings for D

These are my current hand-written SDL3 bindings for use in the D language (I was tired of dealing with automatically generated bindings that sometimes broke in unexpected ways). The bindings are incomplete and I'll be adding more as needed, but right now the event system is available, and some of the new GPU API is available.
The bindings are all aggregated in one file; subsystems are just divided up with comments in what I think is a fairly readable style.
